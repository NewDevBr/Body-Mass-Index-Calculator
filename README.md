### 1. Abstract <a name="Abstract"/>

That project aims: **(I)** Build a simple multiplataform (Android and IOS) mobile software solution, using Flutter framework and Dart programming language, capable to calculates and show the classification about body mass index of according the helth article published by Britsh Jornal of Nutrition, intitled as "Body mass  index as a measure of body fatness: age- and sex-especific preditions formulas". [Click here to see this article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/body-mass-index-as-a-measure-of-body-fatness-age-and-sexspecific-prediction-formulas/9C03B18E1A0E4CDB0441644EE64D9AA2)  **(II)** Introduce one of implements methods to make friedly graphical users interfaces (GUI), as splah screen, micro texts and short labels. **(III)** Develope one method to validate data wroted by users on keyboard.

**Key-Words**: Flutter framework; Dart Lang; Body-Mass-Index; UX Design;
 
### 2. Layout <a name="Layout"/>
The Graphical User Interface (GUI), was projected following UX (User experience) principles.

### 5. Body-Mass-Index (BMI) <a name="BMI"/>

You should no use this data processing to make decisions on real life. Please, consult doctors and health professionals to this. In general, Body Mass Index is used to verify the body development state and specific nutricionals informations about one person. 

The math model to calculates it is:

    f(height, body-weight) = body-weight / (heightÂ²)
