### 1. Abstract <a name="Abstract"/>

This project aims: **(I)** Construct a mobile application, using Flutter and Dart, to calculates and show the body mass index calcs results and classification according to the complementary material hosted by Federal University of Pelotas [Click here to see that pdf material](https://dms.ufpel.edu.br/static/bib/apoio/imc.pdf). **(II)** Develop graphical users interface (GUI) following user experience techniques, as splah screen, micro texts and complementary colors as gradient background and text. **(III)** Implement some method to validate form data inputed by users on keyboard, allowing just typed double datatype.

**Key-Words**: Body-Mass-Index; BMI-classification; Form validation; Gradient;
 
### 2. Layout <a name="Layout"/>
This application layout was concepted thinking about User Experience (UX) Principals:
micro text, typography using two differents fonts (Open Sans and Montserrat) and gradient.
Some graphical resources don't was maked by the project author, as fonts and initial logo.

### 4. Body-Mass-Index (BMI) <a name="BMI"/>

You should no use this data processing to make decisions on real life. Please, consult doctors and health professionals to this. In general, Body Mass Index is used to verify the body development state and specific nutricionals informations about some person.

The math formula to calculates it is:

    f(height, body-weight) = body-weight / (height²)

The height parameter must be entered using meters unity and the body-weight in Kilograms.

To learn or read more about BMI, it's recomended read:
